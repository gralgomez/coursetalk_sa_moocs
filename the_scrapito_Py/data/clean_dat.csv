"5","Jason Tangen, Matthew Thompson, Emma MacKenzie","The Science of Everyday Thinking",10,"University of Queensland","1039 reviews","We will explore the psychology of our everyday thinking: why people believe weird things, how we form and change our opinions, why our expectations skew our judgments, and how we can make better decisions. We’ll discuss and debate topics such as placebos, the paranormal, medicine, miracles, and more.

You will use the scientific method to evaluate claims, make sense of evidence, and understand why we so often make irrational choices. You will begin to rely on slow, effortful, deliberative, analytic, and logical thinking rather than fast, automatic, instinctive, emotional, and stereotypical thinking.

We will provide tools for how to think independently, how to be skeptical, and how to value data over personal experience. We will examine the mental shortcuts that people use and misuse, and apply this knowledge to help make better decisions, and improve critical thinking.","https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/think101x-the-science-of-everyday-thinking-3","edX","Free"
"6","Andrew J. Friedland, Michael Goudzwaard, Justin Richardson, R. Michael Murray, Sawyer Broadley ‘08, Joby Bernstein ’17, Chloe Madill ‘17","Introduction to Environmental Science",10,"Dartmouth College","232 reviews","Introduction to Environmental Science, ENVX, was first offered in early 2015.

Environmental science is the study of patterns and processes in the natural world and their modification by human activity.  To understand current environmental problems, we need to consider physical, biological and chemical processes that are often the basis of those problems. This course will give you the skills necessary to address the environmental issues we are facing today by examining scientific principles and the application of those principles to natural systems.  This course will survey some of the many environmental science topics at an introductory level, ultimately considering the sustainability of human activities on the planet.

Environmental impacts on Earth come from the number of people and the amount and types of resources that they use. By applying scientific principles and considering real-world examples, we will examine:


	The field of environmental science and how to think like an environmental scientist
	The human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment
	Agriculture, soils and the environmental implications of eating meat, vegetables, local, organic, sustainable, industrial and other types of food
	Non-renewable fossil fuels with a focus on coal, petroleum and natural gas and the benefits and consequences of using each
	Renewable fuels such as wind and solar and identify that even renewable “green” energy sources have impacts as well as benefits
	Biodiversity and global change, which are the integrating units of environmental science


Education method
The course will utilize video lectures, interviews with experts, readings, discussions, multiple choice and prompted discussions and one graded quiz per week. There will also be several optional live office hours on Google Hangouts.

Completion of self-assessments, contributions to discussion and quiz scores will determine the final grade.","https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/dartenvs01x-introduction-to-environmental-science-2","edX","Free"

In this groundbreaking course, we invite you on a journey to see the world in new ways and practice a method that allows leaders, entire organizations, and larger social systems to connect with and actualize their highest future possibility.

In January 2015, 30,000 people from 190 countries enrolled in U.Lab. In an exit survey, 52% said it was “eye-opening”, while another 36% called it “life-changing”. U.Lab has inspired the first-known use of a MOOC by a government as a platform for citizens to shape the issues that matter to them, it has been used in management teams of the world’s leading NGOs, and it is now being used in 42 Impact Hubs worldwide – by locally-rooted, globally connected communities of change makers to catalyze systemic change.

In the U.Lab you will learn Theory U, an approach to leading profound change that has been developed by action researchers at MIT, and practiced by leaders around the world, for over 20 years.

You will apply this method to a challenge, issue, or system that matters to you.

And you will have the opportunity to form self-organized Hubs and peer coaching circles with other U.Lab participants; in order to co-sense and co-shape the future that you feel is wanting to emerge in your work, and life, right now.

You will be joining a community that includes national government leaders from Scotland, founders and members of 42 Impact Hubs around the world, business leaders in the U.S, Brazil, and China, and many other inspired change makers from over 190 countries worldwide who are interested in creating more aware, inclusive, sustainable societies.","https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/ulab-transforming-business-society-and-self","edX","Free"

Virtually every day brings news about some “miracle food” that we should be consuming or some ""poison"" we should be avoiding. One day it's tomatoes to prevent cancer, then flaxseed against heart disease or soybeans for menopause. At the same time, we are warned about trans fats, genetically modified foods, aspartame and MSG. Dietary supplements are often touted as the key to health or a factor in morbidity. According to some, dairy products are indispensable while others urge us to avoid them. The same goes for meat, wheat and soy; the list goes on.

This course will shed light on the molecules that constitute our macro and micronutrients and will attempt to clarify a number of the food issues using the most relevant, up-to-date science available. Other topics to be presented will include the diet-cancer relationship, the link between diet and cardiovascular disease, food-borne illnesses, food additives and weight control.","https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/chem181x-food-for-thought-4","edX","Free"

"62","Eric S. Lander, Michelle Mischke, Brian White, Mary Ellen Wiltrout, Graham Walker","Introduction to Biology - The Secret of Life",10,"MIT","58 reviews","7.00x is an introductory level biology course hosted by professor Eric Lander, who was one of the leaders of the Human Genome Project. The course content reflects the topics taught in the MIT introductory biology courses and many biology courses across the world. As a student, you will first focus on the structure and function of macromolecules such as DNA, RNA and proteins. You will discover how changes in the structure of some of these macromolecules alter their functions and what the implications of such changes have on human health. As you continue in the course, you will apply an understanding of heredity and information flow within cells to human health and disease and will learn about molecular biological techniques and their potential to impact our changing world. After you complete this course, you will have a foundation in biology that will allow you to understand the remarkable medical revolution going on today.

Each week features a series of lecture sequences that are supported by interactive video tutorials and interspersed exercises or problems. Students will work on a homework assignment or exam each week. The course will conclude with a comprehensive final exam. 7.00x – The Secret of Life will let you explore the mysteries of biochemistry, genetics, molecular biology, recombinant DNA technology and genomics, and rational medicine. We are excited to take this journey with you!

Before your course starts, try the new edX Demo where you can explore the fun, interactive learning environment and virtual labs. Learn more.","https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/700x-introduction-to-biology-the-secret-of-life-1","edX","Free"

We don't know why the Big Bang happened. We don't know what most of the universe is made of. We don't know whether there is life in space. We don't know how planets form, how black holes get so big, or where the first stars have gone. This course will take you through nine of the greatest unsolved problems of modern astrophysics. We can't promise you the answers, but we will explain what we do and don't know, and give you an up-to-date understanding of current research. This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. 

This is the first of four ANUx courses which together make up the Australian National University's first year astrophysics program.

You will learn how to design and build mobile apps -- apps that are aware of their location, send and receive text messages, and give advice and directions. The only limit on the types of apps you will learn to build is your own imagination!

However, computer science is not just about coding and building apps. We will also learn some of  the fundamental principles of computer science. We'll learn about the potential and the limitations of computing and coding. We'll learn how the Internet works and about the positive and negative aspects of computing in today's society, and much more!

For these broader computing concepts we will work within an emerging curricular framework -- the Computer Science Principles (CSP). The CSP framework is being developed by leading computer science educators from around the country under the auspices of the College Board and with funding support of the National Science Foundation.

In addition to programming and CSP the course is project-based and emphasizes writing, communication, and creativity. Multiple-choice questions, in the style that students can expect to encounter on the AP exam, will also be a key component of this course.","https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/mobile-computing-with-app-inventor-cs-principles","edX","Free"

"166","Edward Slingerland","Chinese Thought: Ancient Wisdom Meets Modern Science - Part 1",10,"University of British Columbia","30 reviews","This course is designed to give students a thorough introduction to early (pre-221 BCE) Chinese thought, its contemporary implications, and the role of religion in human well-being. Important themes to be discussed include the ideal of wu-wei or “effortless action,” the paradox of how one can consciously try not to try, mindfulness techniques and self-cultivation, models of the self and society, rationality versus emotions, trust and human cooperation, and the structure and impact of different spiritual and political ideals.

This period of Chinese history witnessed the formation of all of the major indigenous schools of Chinese thought (Confucianism, Daoism, Mohism and Legalism), which in turn had an impact on the development of East Asian cultural history that is still felt today. We will also explore parallels with Western philosophical and religious traditions, the relevance of early Chinese thought for contemporary debates in ethics, moral education, and political philosophy, and the manner in which early Chinese models of the self anticipate recent developments in the evolutionary and cognitive sciences.

This course provides a full university semester’s worth of material broken into two parts. Each part of the course will last 5 weeks, with a week-long break in between. For each part, there will be four weeks worth of new material. The fifth week will be reserved for review and completion of the final exam.

Part 1 introduces the basic philosophical, religious and scientific concepts that will be drawn upon throughout the course, and then goes on to cover early Shang and Zhou religious thought, the Analects of Confucius, the Daodejing (a Daoist text attributed to Laozi), the utilitarian thinker Mozi, the newly discovered and very exciting Guodian texts, and the momentous philosophical changes that occurred in the mid Warring States period.

Part 2 builds upon Part 1 by exploring late Warring States thinkers such as the Confucian Mencius, the Daoist Zhuangzi, and the return to externalism in the form of Xunzi—who believed Mencius betrayed the original Confucian vision—and his former student Hanfeizi, a “Legalist” thinker who helped lay the foundations for the autocratic system that unified the Warring States into China’s first empire. We will conclude with some reflections on what it means to study religious thought, and the thought of other cultures, in a modern, globalized world. Part 2 can be taken as a stand-alone course, but will be more comprehensible and rewarding with the background provided in Part 1.

Did you know that transposable elements, the genetic information that can move from location to location, make up roughly 50 % of the human genome? Did you know that scientists have linked their movement into specific genes to the causes of certain diseases? You’ll also learn how these “jumping genes” work and how scientists study them in Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.

Are you ready to go beyond the “what"" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?

Take a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins and elements involved in transcription and transposition to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.

Let’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the transcription machinery and mechanisms of transposition. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28.2x Molecular Biology: Transcription and Transposition.

"335","Lukas Chrostowski","Silicon Photonics Design, Fabrication and Data Analysis",10,"University of British Columbia","18 reviews","This short course teaches students and industry professionals how to design integrated optical devices and circuits, using a hands-on approach with commercial tools. We will fabricate your designs using a state-of-the-art ($5M) silicon photonic rapid-prototyping 100 keV electron-beam lithography facility. We will measure your designs using an automated optical probe station and provide you the data. You will then analyze your experimental data.

Why take this course?


	To get hands on design experience with integrated optics
	To learn how to use advanced optical design tools
	To get your design fabricated, and obtain experimental data


The focus of this course is a design project, guided by lectures, tutorials and activities. As a first-time designer, you will design an interferometer, which is a widely used device in many applications such as communications (modulation, switching) and sensing. Specifically, it is Mach-Zehnder Interferometer, consisting of fibre grating couplers, two splitters, and optical waveguides. For advanced designers, this course is an opportunity to design many other devices, such as directional couplers, ring, racetrack and disk resonators, Bragg gratings including grating assisted contra-directional couplers, photonic crystals, multi-mode interference (MMI) couplers, polarization diversity components, mode-division multiplexing (MDM) components and circuits, novel waveguides such as sub-wavelength grating (SWG) and metamaterial waveguides, slot waveguides, etc.

Commercial software tool licenses are provided in this course (Lumerical Solutions, Mentor Graphics, and MATLAB). Open-source alternatives are provided. Mentor Graphics tools are accessed remotely via a cloud service; the others can be run on your own computer.

You will earn a professional certificate from the University of British Columbia and edX upon successful completion of this course. Certificates can be uploaded directly to your LinkedIn profile.


FAQ

How much effort is required?

Since this is a design-based course, students in previous courses have put in between 3-25 hours/week, depending on their background, interest, and the level of complexity of their chosen project. There are also many optional modules in the course, completing all the optional modules increases the time required.

What are the prerequisites for taking this course?

Phot1x is targeted at an audience with a wide range of backgrounds who are committed to learning the material and completing the course design project. The prerequisites are introductory physics, and optics, for example an undergraduate optics or electromagnetics course. Background in microwave/RF would be an asset. No background with integrated optics is assumed. The course uses various computer software, hence a background in basic computer programming is beneficial (e.g., MATLAB, Python).

Do I need to buy a textbook?

The notes, videos and exercises are all sufficient to complete this course. The textbook is optional. Included in the course are several key chapters from the book ""Silicon Photonics Design"", by Lukas Chrostowski and Michael Hochberg, published by Cambridge University Press. The full version (ebook or hardcopy) is available for purchase at www.cambridge.org/9781107085459.

What are the fabrication details? 

Your devices will be fabricated on a Silicon on insulator (SOI) wafer with 220 nm silicon thickness, with a minimum isolated feature size of 60 nm. Each participant is allocated 410 µm x 605 µm of space, enough for >10 devices each (more available on request). One chip is being manufactured and measured for this course, and the measurement data will be provided to the course participants. 

Who will be doing the fabrication and measurements?

The fabrication will be performed by Richard Bojko, at the University of Washington, Nanofabrication Facility. The measurements will be performed by the team of Lukas Chrostowski, at The University of British Columbia.

Will I be getting a physical chip in the mail?

No. Only one chip is being manufactured for this course, and the measurements will be performed at UBC. The measurement data will be provided to the course participants.

Are there opportunities for fabrication beyond this course, including getting chips in the mail?

Yes. Either after, or during the course, you can purchase an entire chip. It will be sent to you directly. Optionally we can perform automated testing for you prior to sending it out. We typically do fabrication runs every two months. Additional options for  obtaining your own chips (EBeam or MPW foundries) will be discussed in the course.

Do you have any advanced silicon photonics courses, and what can I take after Phot1x?

Yes. We offer advanced courses on silicon photonics, including on-site hands-on workshops on Passive silicon photonics (ring resonators, grating couplers, Bragg gratings, etc); Active silicon photonics (modulators, detectors); CMOS electronics for photonics; and Systems, Integration and Packaging. All these workshops include fabrication via MPW foundries. More details can be found at http://siepic.ubc.ca. Phot1X is a good background course for the above workshops.","https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/silicon-photonics-design-fabrication-and-data-analysis","edX","$495.00"

"340","Eric Foner, Tim Shenk, CCNMTL","The Civil War and Reconstruction - 1850-1861: A Nation Divided",10,"Columbia University","18 reviews","A House Divided: The Road to Civil War, 1850-1861 begins by examining how generations of historians have explained the crisis of the Union.  After discussing the institution of slavery and its central role in the southern and national economies, it turns to an account of the political and social history of the 1850s. It traces how the issue of the expansion of slavery came to dominate national politics, and how political leaders struggled, unsuccessfully, to resolve the growing crisis. We will examine the impact of key events such as Bleeding Kansas, the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and John Brown’s raid on Harper’s Ferry, and end with the dissolution of the Union in the winter of 1860-61.

This course is part of the X Series, Civil War and Reconstruction, which introduces students to the most pivotal era in American history. The Civil War transformed the nation by eliminating the threat of secession and destroying the institution of slavery. It raised questions that remain central to our understanding of ourselves as a people and a nation – the balance of power between local and national authority, the boundaries of citizenship, and the meanings of freedom and equality. This X Series will examine the causes of the war, the road to secession, the conduct of the Civil War, the coming of emancipation, and the struggle after the war to breathe meaning into the promise of freedom for four million emancipated slaves. One theme throughout the series is what might be called the politics of history – how the world in which a historian lives affects his or her view of the past, and how historical interpretations reinforce or challenge the social order of the present.

"343","Stéphanie Demoulin","Psychologie de la négociation",10,"Université catholique de Louvain","18 reviews","Souvent confinée à l’étude des techniques permettant de vendre une encyclopédie en 24 volumes à une octogénaire récalcitrante ou à l’art de marchander son salaire, la négociation est souvent abordée sous un angle exclusivement utilitariste. Mais négocier ce n’est pas se limiter à la recherche du bénéfice maximum. La négociation traverse toutes les dimensions de la vie humaine. Nous négocions tous les jours, dans toutes les sphères de notre existence : au travail, avec la famille, les amis… Dès qu’il s’agit de partager des biens matériels mais aussi de résoudre une divergence d’intérêts, de concilier différentes envies, rêves, goûts, couleurs…
 
Ce cours s’éloigne de l’approche classique des négociations et tente de rendre compte des phénomènes psychologiques à la base du comportement. L’approche poursuivie sera descriptive plutôt que prescriptive. Contrairement aux théoriciens du jeu qui « examinent ce que de super-hommes, ultra-intelligents et impeccablement rationnels devraient faire dans les situations compétitives », nous explorerons la façon dont « des êtres imparfaits se comportent dans la réalité » (Raïffa, 1982, p. 21). Ainsi, les êtres humains poursuivent des motivations, ont des attentes, des préjugés, des biais et des émotions. Ils analysent l’information qui leur est soumise et prennent des décisions à travers le spectre de leurs propres limites cognitives. Leurs actions fluctuent en fonction de la situation ou de leur personnalité. Toutes ces variables influencent non seulement le comportement des personnes mais, plus fondamentalement, elles modifient la dynamique même de résolution des divergences. Ce cours mettra en évidence ces variables multiples et offrira aux étudiants une compréhension fine et détaillée des processus psychologiques qui entrent en jeu avant, pendant et après toute négociation.
 

Ce cours sera enseigné en français.
 
Often confined to the study of techniques like selling a 24-volume encyclopedia to a recalcitrant octogenarian or to the art of haggling salary, negotiation is frequently approached from a purely utilitarian perspective. But motivations in negotiations are not limited to the pursuit of maximum profit. Negotiations concern all dimensions of human life. We negotiate every day, in all spheres of our lives: at work, with family, and with friends. We negotiate in attempts to share material goods, but also to solve divergence of interests, to reconcile different desires, dreams, tastes, and colors.
 
This course attempts to account for psychological phenomena at the basis of negotiation behaviors. Our approach will be descriptive rather than prescriptive. Unlike game theorists who “look at what ultra-smart and impeccably rational super-human beings should do in competitive situations,” we will explore how “imperfect beings behave in reality (Raïffa, 1982). Human beings pursue motivations, have expectations, show prejudice, display biases and emotions. They analyze information submitted to them and make decisions that are tainted by their cognitive limitations. Their actions fluctuate as a function of the situation they are embedded in, as well as their personality. All these variables influence not only the behavior of people, but more fundamentally, the very dynamic of negotiation instances. This course will highlight these multiple variables and offer students a detailed understanding of the psychological processes involved before, during, and after negotiation.

Baker, Sera Thornton","Molecular Biology - Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair",10,"MIT","15 reviews","You’re acquainted with your DNA, but did you know that your cells synthesize enough DNA during your lifetime to stretch a lightyear in length? How does the cellular machinery accomplish such a feat without making more mistakes than you can survive? Why isn’t the incidence of cancer even higher than it is? And, if the DNA in each and every cell is two meters long, how is this genetic material compacted to fit inside the cell nucleus without becoming a tangled mess?
 
Are you ready to go beyond the “what"" of scientific information presented in textbooks and explore how scientists deduce the details of these molecular models?
 
Take a behind-the-scenes look at modern molecular genetics, from the classic experimental events that identified the proteins involved in DNA replication and repair to cutting-edge assays that apply the power of genome sequencing. Do you feel confident in your ability to design molecular biology experiments and interpret data from them? We've designed the problems in this course to build your experimental design and data analysis skills.
 
Let’s explore the limits of our current knowledge about the replication machinery and pathways that protect the fidelity of DNA synthesis. If you are up for the challenge, join us in 7.28x Part 1: DNA Replication and Repair.

	Who can register for this course?

	
		Unfortunately, learners from Iran, Sudan and the Crimea region of Ukraine will not be able to register for this course at the present time. 
		While edX has received a license from the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to offer courses to learners from Iran and Sudan our license does not cover this course. 
		Separately, EdX has applied for a license to offer courses to learners in the Crimea region of Ukraine, but we are awaiting a determination from OFAC on that application.

"480","Brian Schmidt, Paul Francis","Astrophysics: Exploring Exoplanets",10,"Australian National University","13 reviews","The discovery of exoplanets is one of the greatest revolutions in modern astrophysics. Twenty years ago, we had no idea whether any of the countless stars out there beyond our solar system had planets or not.

Today, things are totally different. Over 1,000 planetary systems have been discovered. The universe is teeming with planets. And what strange planets they are - hot Jupiter-like planets skimming the surfaces of their stars, cold and lonely free-floating planets far from any star, planets made of diamond, planets with rain made of glass, super-Earths and even planets orbiting neutron stars. In this course, we’ll bring you up-to-date with the latest research on exoplanets, and how this research has revolutionised our understanding of the formation of solar systems like our own.

This course is designed for people who would like to get a deeper understanding of these mysteries than that offered by popular science articles and shows. You will need reasonable high-school level mathematics and physics to get the most out of this course.

This is the second of four ANUx courses which together make up the Australian National University's first year astrophysics program. It follows on from the introductory course on the Greatest Unsolved Mysteries of the Universe, and is followed by courses on the violent universe and on cosmology. These courses compromise the Astrophysics XSeries. Learn more about the XSeries program and register for all the courses in the series today!","https://www.coursetalk.com/providers/edx/courses/anu-astro2x-exoplanets-1","edX","Free"
